  <pre>Mindstorms (1980)</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>Well into a year-long study that put powerful computers in the classrooms of a group of “average” seventh graders, the students were at work on what they called “computer poetry.”</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>They were using computer programs to generate sentences.</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>They gave the computer a syntactic structure within which to make random choices from given lists of words.</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>The result is the kind of concrete poetry we see in the illustration that follows.</pre>

  <pre>One of the students, a thirteen-year-old named Jenny, had deeply touched the project’s staff by asking on the first day of her computer work, “Why were we chosen for this? We’re not the brains.”</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>The study had deliberately chosen children of “average” school performance.</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>One day Jenny came in very excited. She had made a discovery.</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>“Now I know why we have nouns and verbs,” she said.</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>For many years in school Jenny had been drilled in grammatical categories.</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>She had never understood the differences between nouns and verbs and adverbs.</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>But now it was apparent that her difficulty with grammar was not due to an inability to work with logical categories.</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>It was something else. She had simply seen no purpose in the enterprise.</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>She had not been able to make any sense of what grammar was about in the sense of what it might be 'for'.</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>In fact, tracing the connection between learning grammar and improving speech requires a more distanced view of the complex process of learning language than Jenny could have been given at the age she first encountered grammar.</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>She certainly didn't see any way in which grammar could help talking, nor did she think her talking needed any help.</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>Therefore she learned to approach grammar with resentment.</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>And, as is the case for most of us, resentment guaranteed failure.</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>But now, as she tried to get the computer to generate poetry, something remarkable happened.</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>She found herself classifying words into categories, not because she had been told she had to but because she needed to.</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>In order to “teach” her computer to make strings of words that would look like English, she had to “teach” it to choose words of an appropriate class.</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>What she learned about grammar from this experience with a machine was anything but mechanical or routine.</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>Her learning was deep and meaningful. Jenny did more than learn definitions for particular grammatical classes.</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>She understood the general idea that words (like things) can be placed in different groups or sets, and that doing so could work for her.</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>She not only “understood” grammar, she changed her relationship to it.</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>It was “hers,” and during her year with the computer, incidents like this helped Jenny change her image of herself.</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>Her performance changed too; her previously low to average grades became “straight A’s” for her remaining years of school.</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>She learned that she could be “a brain” after all.</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>In 1968-1969, the first class of twelve “average” seventh-grade students at the Muzzy Junior High School in Lexington, Massachusetts, ... wrote programs ... to generate concrete poetry.</pre>
