  <pre>Coetzee, Youth (2003)</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>There is something about programming that flummoxes him... In his naïveté he had imagined that computer programming would be about ways of translating symbolic logic and set theory into digital codes. Instead the talk is all about inventories outflows, about Customer A and Customer B. What are inventories and outflows, and what have they to do with mathematics? He might as well be a clerk sorting cards into batches; he might as well be a traitnee station foreman.</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>Under the shadowless glare of the neon lighting, he feels his very soul to be under attack. The building, a featureless block of concrete and glass, seems to give off a gas, odourless, colourless, that finds its way into his blood and numbs him. IBM, he can swear, is killing him, turning him into a zombie.</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>What is the point of this enterprise anyway? What is the good to a computer programmer, if computer programming is to be his life, to have an MA in English literature? And where are the unrecognized masterpieces that he was going to uncover?</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>Only when the five o'clock flurry is past – the secretaries and punch operators ]eave on the dot, no question of overtime with them - and the evening deepens is he free to leave his desk, wander around, relax. The machine room downstairs, dominated by the huge memory cabinets of the 7090, is more often than not empty; he can run programs on the little 1401 computer, even, surreptitiously, play games on it.</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>What kind of world is this in which he lives? Where can one turn to be free of the fury of politics? Only Sweden seems to be above the fray. Should he throw up everything and catch the next boat to Stockholm? Does one have to speak Swedish to get into Sweden? Does Sweden need computer programmers? Does Sweden even have computers?</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>Despite the designation ›Computer Laboratory‹, there is no actual computer on the premises. To test the programs he is being hired to write, he will have to travel to Cambridge University, which owns one of the three Atlas computers, only three in existence, each slightly different from the others. The Atlas computer - so he reads in the brief placed him on his first morning - is Britain's reply to IBM.</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>What is special about Atlas, what makes it unique among the world's computers, is that it has self-consciousness of a kind. At regular intervals - every ten seconds, or even every second - it interrogates itself, asking itself what tasks it is performing and whether it is performing them with optimal efficiency. If it is not performing efficiently, it will rearrange its tasks and carry them out in a different, better order, thus saving time, which is money.</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>It will be his task to write the routine for the machine to follow at the end of each swing of the magnetic tape. Should it read another swing of tape, it must ask itself? Or should it, on the contrary, break off and read a punched card or a strip of paper tape? Should it write some of the output that has accumulated onto another magnetic tape, or should it do a burst of computing? These questions are to be answered according to the overriding principle of efficiency. He will have as much time as he needs (but preferably only six months, since International Computers is in a race against time) to reduce questions and answers to machine-readable code and test that they are optimally formulated. Each of his fellow programmers has a comparable task and a similar schedule. Meanwhile, engineers at the University of Manchester will be working day and night to perfect the electronic hardware. If all goes according to plan, Atlas will go into production in 1965.</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>Although Atlas is not a machine built to handle textual materials, he uses the dead hours of the night to get it to print out thousands of lines in the style of Pablo Neruda, using as a lexicon a list of the most powerful words in 'The Heights of Macchu Picchu‘, in Nathaniel Tarn's translation. He brings the thick wad of paper back to the Royal Hotel and pores over it. ›The nostalgia of teapots.‹ ›The ardour of shutters.‹ ›Furious horsemen.‹</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>If / he cannot, for the present, write poetry that comes from the heart, if his heart is not in the right state to generate poetry of its own, can he at least string together pseudo-poems made up of phrases generated by a machine, and thus, by going through the motions of writing, learn again to write?</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>Is it fair to be using mechanical aids to writing - fair to other poets, fair to the dead masters?</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>The Surrealists wrote words on slips of paper and shook them up in a hat and drew words at random to make up lines. William Burroughs cuts up pages and shuffles them and puts the bits together. Is he not doing the same kind of thing? Or do his huge resources - what other poet in England, in the world, has a machine of this size at his command - turn quantity into quality?</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>Yet might it not be argued that the invention of computers has changed the nature of art, by making the author and the condition of the author’s heart irrelevant?</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>On the Third Programme he has heard music from the studios of Radio Cologne, music spliced together from electronic whoops and crackles and street noise and snippets of old recordings and fragments of speech. Is it not rime for poetry to catch up with music?</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>He sends a selection of his Neruda poems to a friend in Cape Town, who publishes them in a magazine he edits. A local newspaper reprints one of the computer poems with a derisive commentary. For a day or two, back in Cape Town, he is notorious as the barbarian who wants to replace Shakespeare with a machine.</pre>
