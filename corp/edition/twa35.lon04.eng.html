  <pre>Twain, From the “London Times” of 1904 (1898)</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>As soon as the Paris contract released the telelectroscope, it was delivered to public use, and was soon connected with the telephonic systems of the whole world. The improved »limitless-distance« telephone was presently introduced, and the daily doings of the globe made visible to everybody, and audibly discussable, too, by witnesses separated by any number of leagues.</pre>
  <pre>——————————————————————————————</pre>
  <pre>The connection was made with the international telephone-station, and day by day, and night by night, he called up one corner of the globe after another, and looked upon its life, and studied its strange sights, and spoke with its people, and realized that by grace of this marvelous instrument he was almost as free as the birds of the air... Now and then I would hear him say, »Give me Yedo«; next, »Give me Hong-Kong«; next, »Give me Melbourne«.</pre>
