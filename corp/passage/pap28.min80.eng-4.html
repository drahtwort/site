  <pre>In fact, tracing the connection between learning grammar and improving speech requires a more distanced view of the complex process of learning language than Jenny could have been given at the age she first encountered grammar. She certainly didn't see any way in which grammar could help talking, nor did she think her talking needed any help. Therefore she learned to approach grammar with resentment. And, as is the case for most of us, resentment guaranteed failure. But now, as she tried to get the computer to generate poetry, something remarkable happened. She found herself classifying words into categories, not because she had been told she had to but because she needed to. In order to "teach" her computer to make strings of words that would look like English, she had to "teach" it to choose words of an appropriate class. What she learned about grammar from this experience with a machine was anything but mechanical or routine. Her learning was deep and meaningful. Jenny did more than learn definitions for particular grammatical classes. She understood the general idea that words (like things) can be placed in different groups or sets, and that doing so could work for her. She not only "understood" grammar, she changed her relationship to it. It was "hers," and during her year with the computer, incidents like this helped Jenny change her image of herself. Her performance changed too; her previously low to average grades became "straight A's" for her remaining years of school. She learned that she could be "a brain" after all.</pre>
